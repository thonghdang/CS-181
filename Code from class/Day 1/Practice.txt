Practice:  Write a program that checks whether a password is valid.  Use a method (or methods) that ensures an input string is at least 8 characters long, has at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter, and contains at least one digit.  You'll also need to use the String methods to access individual characters of the string such as .charAt() (see Table 9 on page 63 of the text.)
